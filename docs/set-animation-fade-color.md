# set animation fade color

Sets the color to fade the screen to when using the "fade to custom color" animation type. This block only has an effect when the animation type is set to "fade to custom color".

The color should be written in hex code format. For example, #000000 is black, #ffffff is white, and #ff0000 is bright red!

```sig
overworld.setAnimationFadeColor("#000000")
```

This block does nothing if you are using "continuous mode".
