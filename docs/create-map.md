# create map

These blocks are used to create the grid for the overworld extension. The tilemaps with the number 16 next to them use 16x16 tiles, and the tilemaps with the number 8 use 8x8 tiles.

When creating the overworld grid, you can also use the normal tilemap blocks from the Scene category or the arcade-tile-util extension. Simply create a double array filled with tilemaps!
